A lightweight React-TypeScript resume web template for all people.

[LIVE DEMO](https://kiendang.com)

## Do you want to use it on your own?

This project is completely free of charge. It can be customised and used by anybody simply by modifying JSON config and components to tailor with their needs.

If you would like to use this template for your own personal resume website, read on to find how to build your own copy.

**The output files are just JavaScript and HTML.** ðŸ¤©

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (the most recent LTS version)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (the most recent stable version)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for development.

## Development setup

Open Windows PowerShell and `cd` to the project directory, run:

### `yarn install`

This is one-time command to install all dependencies of the project. You will not run any other commands if the dependencies have not yet been installed.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Production build

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

TLDR: The production needs to be run on a server although it does not contains server side script. This is because the build created filenames with the hashes and `%PUBLIC_URL%` paths. You might be interested in setting up a static server for testing the production. For environments using Node, the easiest way to handle this would be to install [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve) and let it handle the rest:

```
yarn global add serve
serve -s build
```
