                      I had the pleasure of working with Kien for a little over a year â€” he was hard working,
                      passionate about quality software engineering and an exceptional problem solver.
                      There was no task too difficult for Kien, and he continued to impress with great solutions to hard problems.

                      I had the pleasure of working with Kien for a year and in that time he impressed me greatly with his ability
                      to pick up anything that was asked of him. He definitely punched above his weight and is a natural.
                      I'd recommend him to anyone and would happily provide a reference for him. He has a great attitude and always tries to please.

                      I've worked with and placed Kien with one of my clients, receiving positive feedback on his work and ethics.

                      and assisting him in finding his next job opportunity.
